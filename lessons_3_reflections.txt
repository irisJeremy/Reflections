When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

A remote repository can be accessed by others, so you may prefer to use remote repo's when you are working in a group. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

One may not want to pull every branch from a repo, and so the changes that are pulled manually can be easier managed. It may also be the case that there will be conflict between repositories that you have not finished resolving yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks function only to copy an existing repository on GitHub into a repository onto your GitHub profile. Clones of repositories can be between local and remote repositories or local to local. Branches are used when two versions of the same files go different paths when lines are added or removed. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

Copying the last known state allows you to modify files offline but remain up to date to a recent version of the remote files.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

Without using Git or GitHub, one may use Google Sheets, or OneDrive. There is also emailing files, but this is not as clean of a format to keep. With GitHub, the format of sharing, updating, and merging work is a core feature of design. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
